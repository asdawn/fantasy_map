# Building fantasy maps - a GIS approach

    Remember, related techniques are also useful for other purposes. 
    For example, the river generation algorithm can be used in analyzing 
    the flow of money, vehicles or other things.

## 1. What kind of data are needed in a real-world map?

In GIS, map datasets are often managed as layers. 

In some commercial navigation map\*, the layers are:

1. Basemap Polygons
+ Boundaries of lands, islands, oceans, (large) rivers and lakes
+ Boundaries of countries and cities
+ Boundaries of built-up areas, residential areas, colleges, hospitals and etc.

2. Basemap Lines
+ Boundary lines of Basemap polygons
+ Small rivers
+ Railway

3. Point of interest
200+ classes of POIs

4. Roads
Highways, express ways and freeways

5. Labels
Name of map objects that should be labeled out.
Different labels for different scales.

6. Terrain dataset
DEM and TIN

7. Satellite images

\* *NavInfo, one of the top map data providers*

With such datasets, you can create a map like Google or OSM's.
